Summary
=======

In this space you're gonna find some examples I made for understanding Express, which is a web framework 
(I think it could be used for more things than that) based on Node.js.

So far I found very powerful technologies involved, some immature at this stage, but really promising.

My intention is to start including concepts I think are necessary for any application which may scale and 
be "easy" to maintain.

I'm planning to include things like: DAO, Facades, Singletons, Factories, ORM, UnitTesting, Documentation, 
Services (as in decoupling, and not WS specifically), and REST. Later, my intention is to play a little 
with HBase or MongoDB... 

Let's see how this thing goes. At this point I only have one project, sqlite, which is a very simple 
application considering a REST API, some concepts mentioned above, and persistence over a sqlite database. 
Refer to each example README for more details and project's wiki.

Cheers,
