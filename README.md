Summary
=======

I've been playing with Node.js for several days and started to ask myself how an application for real environments should be... This is how I got here, wanting to clarify common things/problems such as: i18n, MVC, DAO, SOA, REST, testing (xUnit style), documentation (Javadoc style), etc.

I hope this "conventions" (set of technologies and practices) help other programmers facing similar problems. 

For a complete documentation please refer to: https://github.com/camposer/express-examples/wiki

Cheers,
